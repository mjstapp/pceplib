For active development, a feature/topic branch should be created off of the devel branch.
Pull Requests to master will be rejected.
Periodically, master will be rebased with devel and relevant tags will be created.
As releases are created, a devel-X.Y branch will be created where bug fixes for that release
should be pushed, and later cherry-pick'ed on the devel branch.
